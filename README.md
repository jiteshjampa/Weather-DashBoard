<p id="description">The Weather Dashboard project is a user-friendly web application that allows users to search for and save their favorite cities to view current weather conditions. Users can enter a city name which fetches real-time weather data including temperature weather conditions and icons representing the weather type (e.g. sun rain snow). The app also saves the last searched city in local storage so users can quickly view the weather for that city when they revisit the app. Additionally users can add cities to a favorites list which is stored in a local JSON server making it easy to manage and remove favorite locations as desired. The project leverages React for a responsive and interactive UI Axios for API requests and uses icons and images for a visually engaging experience.</p>
